---

## üöÄ Project Description

The Student Platform Project is a full-stack web application designed as a dynamic social hub for students. Built with a robust **React** frontend and a powerful **Express.js** and **Node.js** backend, the platform is centered around an organization-based structure. It provides a secure environment for content creation and interaction, underpinned by a sophisticated role-based access control system and a **PostgreSQL** database. The application's core strength lies in its integrated moderation capabilities, ensuring a safe and managed community space.

## ‚ú® Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management System

The platform features a sophisticated user hierarchy with role-based access control.
* **User Types:** Supports three distinct user roles: **Membru** (Regular Member), **Moderator**, and **Administrator**.
* **Account Features:** Includes user registration with email confirmation, password reset functionality, profile editing, and account status management (active/banned).

### 2. Organization System

Content and users are organized around institutional structures.
* **Organization Management:** Users can belong to various organizations.
* **Following System:** Users can follow and unfollow organizations to personalize their content feeds.
* **Admin Controls:** Administrators have full control to create and manage organizations.

### 3. Post Creation & Management

A rich content creation system with media support.
* **Post Creation:** Users can create posts with titles, descriptions, and up to five media attachments.
* **Content Moderation:** Posts can be filtered by organization and require a review process, where they are assigned to moderators.

### 4. Advanced Content Features

The platform includes a variety of advanced features to enhance user engagement.
* **Media Handling:** A robust file upload system with image optimization, caching, and real-time preview functionality.
* **Comment System:** Supports threaded comments and nested replies, with edit and delete functionality.
* **Interaction Features:** Users can like and unlike posts and comments. Personalized feeds are generated based on the organizations a user follows.

### 5. Moderation & Reporting System

A comprehensive framework for content oversight.
* **Reporting Mechanism:** Users can report inappropriate posts and comments.
* **Moderation Workflow:** Moderators are assigned posts for review and can manage reports. Posts have different status levels to track the review process.
* **Administrative Controls:** Administrators can ban/unban users, manage user roles, and have full oversight of all platform data.

### 6. Notification System

Real-time user engagement through a comprehensive notification system.
* **Activity Notifications:** Users receive notifications for various activities, such as likes or comments on their posts.
* **Read Status:** Functionality to mark notifications as read.

### 7. Security & Authentication

Robust security measures protect the platform.
* **JWT Authentication:** Secure token-based authentication is used to manage user sessions.
* **Email Verification:** New accounts require email confirmation to ensure authenticity.
* **Role-Based Access:** All routes are protected by middleware, ensuring users can only access features based on their assigned role and account status.
